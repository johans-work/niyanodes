## overview

Niya nodes is a new tool for abstracting, implementing, and utilizing anything that can be abstracted by the user. The app is being built at [nod.ing](http://nod.ing/).

## node basics

If we take a node as a point in a tree and an abstraction as a name for a pattern at every node, we get an abstraction tree, aka, a niya node tree. 

Each node is an abstraction that has a name, implementation, and address. A name is any fitting string of letters. An implementation is anything that a computer can remember or access. And an address is just the names of its parent nodes in order. Users build their nodes and trees, then use and share them. Or, "noding" for short.

There isn't much new here. Any time you have nodes that progressively lead to more nodes, you inevitably get a tree. Your file system is essentially a node tree, and so is the web. What's new is reducing a system to only these abstractions, and being able to start there, with what's inevitable. It's abstraction, abstracted. A new computational canvas for everything.

## type basics

Each node is an instance of a type in a tree. 

## implementation basics

Niya itself is just an abstraction in need of an implementation on a niya node tree, and is implementation agnostic. Choose the type that works best for you, or build your own. 


##

Just as an abstract of a paper is a smaller pattern that describes a larger pattern, so are all words in Enlgish that represent their meaning, and names of people that represent each person. The names form a name space that allows us to differentiate each abstraction individually.


, and not nodejs, or anything specific in networking.
