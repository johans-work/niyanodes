## overview

A framework for abstracting, implementing, and using anything that can be abstracted by the user.

## intro

Both the words node and abstraction here mean what they mean in English. A node is just a point in a tree or a diagram, and not nodejs, or anything specific in networking. An abstraction is just the naming of patterns. So all words in Enlgish are abstractions of their meaning, and names of people are abstractions of each person. THe names form a name space, and so long as there are no name collisions, we're able to differentiate each abstraction individually.

Each node has a name, an implementation, and a location. This simply translates to each node being an instance of a type in a tree. Users then build their nodes, their trees, then use and own the systems they've created or copied. And that really is all there is to it. 

The niyanodes app is the nod.ing app, and anyone can get started right away.
