## overview

A framework for abstracting, implementing, and using anything that can be abstracted by the user.

## intro

A node here is the original familiar meaning of the word, and is just a point in a tree or a diagram, and not nodejs, or anything specific in networking.

An abstraction is just the naming of patterns. You may be less familiar with this definition, and it may seem unique. But just as an abstract of a paper is a smaller pattern that describes a larger pattern, so are all words in Enlgish language that represent their meaning, and names of people that represent each person. The names form a name space, and so long as there are no name collisions, we're able to differentiate each abstraction individually.

Each node has a name, an implementation, and a location. This simply translates to each node being an instance of a type in a tree. Users then build their nodes, their trees, then use and own the systems they've created or copied. And that really is all there is to it. 

The niyanodes app is the nod.ing app, and anyone can get started right away.
