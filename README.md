## overview

Niya nodes is a framework for abstracting, implementing, and using anything that can be abstracted by the user. The noding app serves as a demo and a provider of this technology.

## basics

Think of a node as just a point in a tree or a diagram. Think of an abstraction as just a name of a pattern. Each node is an abstraction that has a name, an implementation, and a location. And that really is all there is to it. 



This simply translates to each node being an instance of a type in a tree. Users then build their nodes, their trees, then use and own the systems they've created or copied. 




Just as an abstract of a paper is a smaller pattern that describes a larger pattern, so are all words in Enlgish that represent their meaning, and names of people that represent each person. The names form a name space that allows us to differentiate each abstraction individually.


, and not nodejs, or anything specific in networking.
